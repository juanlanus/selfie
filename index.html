            <h2>What can I do</h2>
            <div class="itemsGroupDescription">
              <p>I do <em>interaction design</em>, that is, I design the way users will 
              interact with the application's <em>user interface</em> (UI). </p>
              <p>This is not graphics design, which is more related to the looks of the
              UI in a static way (so you won't see flashy effects in this portfolio
              purposely kept as plain-vanilla as possible). </p>
              <p><em>Interaction design</em> is related to the way people
              <em>dynamically</em> interact with the UI. </p>
              <p>Some of these pages are intended to showcase actions, each one approached
              in a slightly innovative way that the appropriate users should be able to
              perform with ease once they get to know the purpose of its context. </p>

              <h3>Why should you care?</h3>
              <p>You should if you publish web sites or applications and want your public
              to use them happily. </p>
              <p>It's pretty basic. If they get stuck, or if the interaction requires too 
              much effort, thay just leave. It happened to all of us, so many times. </p>
              <p>The users approach your application with a purpose, and good interactions
              (high usability) is intended for them to fulfill that purpose with ease,
              without even noticing it. Like when you go to a building and use the elevator
              with no effort (no cognitive load). </p>

              <h3>Usable by design</h3>

              <div class="sideImage">
                <img src="media/RelativeCostOfAnError.png">
              </div>

              <p>Good interaction is designed on purpose, up front, before writing the 
              first line of code. </p>
              <p>If done so then coding comes out much faster (30% cheaper was reported), 
              and the application itself is accepted by the users also much faster. </p>
              <p>The other way is to come out with a dubious UI and turn it acceptable
              after several rounds of user testing. </p>
              <p>It's coming out with a good UI and to make it excellent with user testing
              vs. to start with a mediocre UI and turn it acceptable after the same or
              more user testing. </p>
              <p>The interaction defects are expensive to fix once the application is
              written, so the best policy is to fix them at the outset. </p>
              <p>This is done by writing definitions of the interaction before going
              graphical, and checking them with the users or their proxies. </p>

                  The requirement was to allow the users to select items from a rather
                  lengthy set where the structure of the data was known to be hierarchical.

                  The use case was about managing a big number of columns of a grid, allowing
                  to select and reorder them. <br>
                  There is also a number of locked columns, that are displayed the first, and
                  thus need to be grouped. <br>
                  Although the grid allows to manage its columns through direct action, this
                  implies lots of horizontal scrolling and is usable only for small changes.
