    <p>Course description: </p>
      <p>After taking this short course (half to one hour) you will have 
      acquired some informal knowledge about the binary numbering system 
      by recognizing the common ground it has with the familiar decimal 
      numbering system. </p>
      <p>Additionally, you will understand the meaning of a number of terms 
      used to express computer characteristics like "megabyte" and others. </p>

  <h2 id="L366">The decimal number system</h2>

  <p>According to several dictionaries, the decimal number system that we use so
  extensively is&nbsp;...</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&#x25b8; <strong>noun</strong>: a positional system of numeration that
    uses decimal digits and a base of 10</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Notice that the definition correctly uses the indefinite article "a"
  accounting for the fact that there are <em>other</em> number systems, like for
  example the <em>binary number system</em>. </p>

  <p>We always use the decimal system in real life in such an exclusive fashion
  that we might end up thinking that it is the one and only number system, but in
  fact it's just one in the crowd. </p>

  <div class="imgR" style="margin:0 0 .5em 1em;">
  <img alt="roman numers" src="mooc/AdmiraltyArchLondonCloseup.jpg"></div>

  <p>Like for example there is the Roman number system, that was used until
  recently. "Recently" is the 14th. century, when the Roman numbering system
  began to be replaced by the more convenient Hindu-Arabic numerals; however this
  process was gradual, and the use of Roman numerals in some minor applications
  continues to this day, for example in clock faces.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>Notice that the Roman numbering system does not have a zero. The zero is
  said to be invented by the Indians near year 500 A.D. and is essential to any
  modern number system, including the decimal and the binary systems.</p>

  <div class="imgR" style="margin:0 0 .5em 1em;">
  <img alt="Altamira hands" src="mooc/275823019_568ed233ab_z.jpg"> </div>

  <p>A decimal number system is somehow natural for we humans because
  we have ten fingers in our hands (mostly everybody).</p>

  <p>Some people think that it would be better if we had twelve fingers, because
  this would have led to a 12-based number system, being the advantage that 12 is
  exactly divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 6, and that would have simplified many
  arithmetic problems. But we have ten fingers so we have to settle with a number
  base that's only divisible by 2 and 5. Families should have either two or five
  children, but not three. </p>

  <p>The idea is that there is nothing special or magic in the number 10 in
  addition to it's fit to human anatomy. </p>

  </div>

  <div class="onePage">
  <h3 id="L113">Counting with fingers</h3>

  <div class="imgR">
  <img alt="tally counter" src="mooc/tally-counter.jpg" style="width:200px;">
  </div>

  <p>Lets imagine a method to count with our fingers. There are smarter methods,
  but this one is convenient for the explanation.</p>

  <p>We are purchasing cattle; sheep. The tally counter, like the one in the
  picture, has not been invented yet, so we use our fingers. </p>

  <p>As each animal passes through a narrow aperture of the stone fence we count
  it by extending another finger.</p>

  <p>After counting 10 sheep I run out of fingers but fortunately my brother is
  participating. He counts the number of times I run out of fingers, using his
  fingers the same way I do.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>After counting 99 sheep both me and my brother have all our fingers
  commited, but fortunately the family is large and another sibling comes to the
  rescue counting the number of times my brother ran out of fingers and so we can
  count up to 999 which is enough for now.</p>

  <p>Having the next brother count one more is the "carry" of when we learned to
  sum in school. </p>

  <p>So we bought less than 1000 sheep and it was possible to count them with the
  participation of only three people. Notice that if we had to count more sheep,
  say 9999, we would need one additional brother or the litle tally counter
  pictured above. Each time we add a brother the maximum number increments
  tenfold. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="onePage">
  <h2 id="L3661">The binary number system</h2>

  <div class="imgR">
  <img alt="one-finger hand" src="mooc/Hands-One-finger-icon.png"></div>

  <p>If instead of having ten fingers we had only one, would be able to count
  that many sheep? </p>

  <p>Of course the answer is yes, but with a caveat: we would need more people
  because each of us would run out of fingers sooner than if we had 10.</p>

  <p>Let's start counting. As the first sheep passes I extend my single finger.
  When the second sheep comes I flex my finger and tell my brother B to extend
  his (I'm brother A). Next sheep, the third, I extend my single finger and now
  me and my brother B both are out of fingers so brother C joins. Another sheep
  comes, C extends his finger and me and B flex our's. And so on.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>If a brother with his finger extended was represented with the symbol "1"
  and one with his finger flexed with "0", then the counting sequence would look
  thus:</p>

  <p>As can be seen in the last line, to count 32 or more sheep we need six brothers,
  something that was possible with only two when we used decimal numbers. Each time
  we add a brother the maximum number doubles. </p>

  <p>It can also be noticed that two, the base of the binary system, expressed as a
  binary number is written 10, while the base of the decimal system expressed
  as a decimal number is also 10. This holds true for all bases. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="onePage">
  <h3 id="L764">Who would want to count in such a contrived way?</h3>

  <p>Digital devices do. Their single finger hand is a type of circuit called
  "flip-flop" that can be in one of two states: either "flipped" or "flopped",
  never an in-between state. </p>

  <p>It is easy and safe to implement a circuit or other device type that works
  that way.</p>

  <div class="imgR">
  <img alt="opened hard disk" src="mooc/320px-Apertura_hard_disk_04.jpg"></div>

  <p>For example in hard disks, that store information digitally in the form of
  extremely tiny magnetized dots on a spinning platter, each dot represents
  a binary digit, a zero or a one, depending on the polarity of the magnetic
  field.</p>

  <p>Another example of binary signals is a communication channels, like for
  example our domestic Internet connections, that transmit streams of electric
  signals representing bits. Millions per second, depending on the price of the
  connection. A "6 mega internet connection" is capable of transmitting 6 
  million bits per second. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="onePage">

  <h3 id="L1729">Binary numbers are horrible</h3>

  <p>As we saw in the sheep counting example, binary numbers (numbers expressed
  in base 2) become very long quickly. Another issue is that they are made only of
  zeros and ones and thus they are monotonous. </p>

  <p>It is almost impossible to remember or communicate binary numbers without
  making errors. For example a not-so-large number like one million expressed in
  binary is 11110100001001000000. How would you read this number over the phone
  to your rather-deaf aunt? </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>In decimal notation we use thousand separators to be able to read
  lengthy numbers more safely. For example a long number like 340923476504734876
  is easier to grasp with thousand separators: 340,923,476,504,734,876 and with a
  bit of luck one could read it correctly. </p>

  <p>Now, the same number in binary is this long string:</p>

  <p>10010111011001101000001100001111000101001111110110010011100</p>

  <p>In binary there is a sort of "thousand separators" in groups of four instead
  of three as in decimal. Notice that four is a power of 2: <code> 4 = 2<span
  style="font-size: x-small; vertical-align: super;">2</span> = 2 × 2 </code> and
  the powers of 2 always show up when there is digital stuff around. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>The long number would look like this: </p>
  <style>
            .binHex    { margin-right:1.5em;}
            .binHex td { text-align:center; line-height:75%; }</style>

  <p>This is not a simple separation in fixed length groups of four bits but a
  "recodification". </p>

  <p>In binary each 4-bit goup can have one of 16 possible values, and each value
  is assigned a symbol according to the table at the right.</p>

  <p>The first 10 values, zero to 9, are conveniently assigned the symbols "0"
  through "9". Once we run out of digits we start with the letters "a" through
  "f".</p>

  <p>Numbers expressed like this are called "hexadecimal numbers" because
  actually they are not any more in base 2 but in base 16. Hence the need for 16
  symbols, the 10 digits and the first 6 letters of the alphabet. </p>

  <p>And again, the base of the base-16 numbering system expressed as a base-16
  number is 10. </p>

  <h3 id="L792">byte</h3>

  <blockquote>
    &#x25b8; noun: a sequence of 8 bits (enough to represent one character of
    alphanumeric data) </blockquote>

  <p>You might have been told once and again that all digital information is made
  out of <em>bits</em>. </p>

  <p>But given how deadly simple a bit is, seems as if a lot of magic was needed
  between a set of bits and watching an HD film in a notebook; the film obviously
  is made up of bits and only bits, because bits is the only thing any computer
  can handle and store.</p>

  <p>The key is organization, structure. When we were counting sheep with single
  fingers and we added more and more brothers to hold bits, those brothers were
  arranged in a certain order. Not respecting the order would have led to a count
  error and possibly a fight with the cattle sellers with eventual deadly
  consequences.</p>

  <p>A first organization level is lumping the bits in bytes. The capacities of
  the computer's data storage capacities are expressed in bytes. For example as
  of this writing hard disks tend to have capacities like 1,099,511,627,776
  bytes. Obviously we don't say such a number, we say "one terabyte" and write
  "1TB". This numer is another power of 2, namely 2<span
  style="font-size: x-small; vertical-align: super;">40</span>, that is, a one
  followed by 40 zeros in binary notation, 10000000000 in hexadecimal.</p>

  <p>People talk about kilobytes and megabytes. If it seems as if as soon as one
  learns the dimension of one of these numbers, a new one arises.</p>

  <p>Actually it's not that "it seems", it's actually happening. </p>

  <p>These words are measure units, like the Kg (Kilogram) that is used to
  measure the weight of packed sugar. A Kilogram is named so because it's made of
  1,000g (a thousand grams) and "<a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-" target="_blank">Kilo</a>" is derived from the Greek
  word &chi;&#x3af;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&iota; (chilioi), meaning
  "thousand".</p>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>The table shows the commonly used prefixes and their meaning, together with
  the next generation prefixes that might be current in the future if the trend
  continues. </p>

  <p>Notice that the table is not about units but prefixes, hence the "-" at the
  end of each prefix denoting that the word is incomplete. One can only say "one
  mega" when it's implied what are you talking about. </p>

  <p>The prefixes are to be combined with unit names like "meter" making, for
  example, "kilometer". But we are interested in computer stuff, so we stick to
  computer related units and how to use them.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>Notice in the table that, for example, in the "mega" row 10<sup>6</sup> is
  related to 2<sup>20</sup>. This is because 1,000,000 is close to 1,048,576
  albeit not exactly equal. Actually these units should refer to the decimal,
  slightly lower numbers. A new set of units is out there that refers to the 2's
  power numbers, like "mibi" that means exactly 1,048,576-whatever. The prefixes
  are "kibi", "mebi", "gibi", "tebi" and so on, seldom seen. </p>

  <img alt="512M memory modules"
  src="mooc/320px-Memory_module_DDRAM_20-03-2006.jpg"></div>

  <p>The first PCs had memory ("RAM" or "main memory") sizes of about 32
  Kilobytes or 64 Kilobytes (KB). Current computers have 2 gigabytes and more,
  about 100,000 times growth. </p>

  <p>When you purchase a new PC you want it to have as much RAM as possible, but
  over time it will not be enough and you will want to expand it by adding
  current versions of the memory modules shown in the picture (512MB each, year
  2006).</p>

  <p>So memory size was measured in KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), and is
  expressed GB (gigabytes) for now.</p>

  <p>Hard disks, used by the computer to store your files, had capacities
  measured in MB , then GB and currently TB.</p>

  <p>Both main memory and disk sizes are expressed as an ever-growing number of
  <em>bytes</em>. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <h4 id="L1313">Hz</h4>

  <p>One "Hertz" is one cycle per second. It's a <em>frequency</em> unit. For
  example alternate current (the "AC" in "AC-DC") oscilates at 50Hz or 60Hz
  depending on the country. Sounds range from 20Hz bass to 20KHz (20,000Hz) high
  pitch. </p>

  <p>The speed of PCs is measured as the number of "cycles" per second they can
  perform, the number of Hz.</p>

  <p>The first PC micro processors ran at 8,66MHz, current PCs have speeds in the
  order of 2 to 3 GHz, 1,000 times faster. A few years ago the race for speed hit
  phisycal limits, so the microprocessor makers started to lump two or four
  processors in a single unit so the theoretical computing power is the number of
  GHz times the number of processors in the chip.</p>

  <p>To do their work the microprocessors need to fetch data from and store data
  into, the main memory. The memory speed needs to be in tune with the
  processor's speed else there might be a significant impact in overall
  throughput. That's why at some point in time the manufacturers started to
  advertise the memory speed - also measured in MHz, or GHz, in addition to the
  processor speed.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <h4 id="L1326">bit/sec </h4>

  <p>Internet connection speeds are measured in bits per second. Bits, not
  bytes.</p>

  <p>Old telephone modems, used for dial-up connections to the Internet in the
  nineties, had speeds ranging from 14,4Kb/s (notice the lowercase "b" meaning
  "bit", not "Byte"). </p>

  <p>Current broadband connections are much faster, in the order of 10Mb/s or
  Mbps.</p>

  <p>That's why when you are downloading big files the number of bytes per second
  reported by the web browser is at best about one tenth of your nominal speed.

  symbols needed, check the "<a
  href="http://copypastecharacter.com/all-characters"
  target="_blank">CopyPasteCharacter</a>" page to see for yourself. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>A byte was enough to represent the limited set of characters that was
  workable until computers turned really international. Now the Unicode Character
  Standard defined more than 95,000 characters with 2 and 4 byte per character
  codes. </p>

  <p>The <a href="http://old.no/charmap/iso-8859-1.html"
  target="_blank">table</a> shows a relationship between byte values and
  displayed or printed characters. This arrangement is one of the many possible
  "encodings". This particular encoding is vastly used in a gazillion web pages,
  millions of people abide by it, is known as "<a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1" target="_blank">ISO 8859/1</a>" or "Latin 1"
  and is an extension of the older ASCII encoding. This is not Unicode, which is
  too complex for the purpose of this course. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>To interpret the table remember that a byte has 8 bits and thus it can be
  expressed as 2 hexadecimal digits. The table contains 256 cells (16 × 16) and
  maps from byte values to character symbols, for example the uppercase "W" is in
  the row with "5-" at the left (first hex character) and in the column with "-7"
  at the top (second hex character) - try parking the mouse pointer over the "W"
  in the table. This means that the hexadecimal code for the "W" is 57, or
  0101 0111, the binary equivalents of the hex digits 5 and 7.</p>

  <p>So this is how it works at its lowest level: a massive agreement on how to
  interpret a bit structure, in this case a simple set of 8 bits. Millions of
  computers displaying a "W" when there is a byte containing
  <code>01010111</code>. </p>

  <div class="onePage">
  <h3 id="L91654">Bytes and colors </h3>

  <p>This section is another example of structure. You have heard of
  specifications for monitor screens that mention "24 bit color" or "16 million
  colors", or the acronym "RGB", or "screen resolution". This section is about
  it. </p>

  <p>In computer graphical output, like a screen or printed matter, the text and
  the images are made out of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"
  target="_blank">pixels</a>", tiny dots emitting light of a given color. If
  you'd look at the screen with a magnifying glass you would notice them. The
  pixels tidily aligned in rows and columns of an array. </p>

  <p>As technology progresses the pixels tend to become smaller and smaller. A
  rather recent breakthrough (as of this writing, Jan 2014) are <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display" target="_blank">the "Retina" class
  displays</a> that exhibit the highest pixel densities at 200~300+ pixels per
  inch (ppi), about twice as before. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>With the pixel sizes shrinking, the number of pixels needed to put together
  a screen of a given size has to grow. Doubling the ppi means multiplying the
  number of pixels by 4, right? Because it doubled both the vertical and the
  horizontal sizes.</p>

  <p>For example the first two generations of Apple iPads have screens displaying
  1024×768 pixels, and the following 3rd and 4th generations have 2048×1536
  resolutions (786,432 vs. 3,145,728 pixels), all of them with 9.7 inch screens.
  </p>

  <p>Similarly, we have also witnessed the grow of the advertised number of
  pixels in digital photo cameras, from a few hundred thousands up to many
  millions. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <div class="imgR">
  <img alt="RG color wheel" src="mooc/rgb.png"></div>

  <p>Each pixel's color is encoded (most of the times) using 3 bytes, one for
  each of the three primary colors: <strong>R</strong>ed, <strong>G</strong>reen
  and <strong>B</strong>lue, thus the "<strong>RGB</strong>" acronym. The pixel
  behaves as three tiny lights tightly packed together: a red light, a green
  light and a blue one. Each byte controls the amount of light of each color that
  the pixel has to emit to render the desired color. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
  <p>Each of the three bytes of a pixel's color is treated as a number between 0
  and 255 (binary 00000000 all the way through 11111111) meaning the amount of
  the associated color to be emitted by the pixel. If the three bytes contain
  zero the pixel will not emit any light of any color and the result will be
  black. On the other side, if all three contain the value 255 the pixel will
  fully emit all three colors and the outcome will be white. The arrangement (0,
  0, 255) means no red, no green and full blue, so the pixel will render primary
  blue. </p>

    <p>From the circles diagram it can be seen that full red, full green and zero
    blue renders pure yellow.</p>

    <p>Using hexadecimal notation the color for that yellow pixel will be
    quantified thus: ff ff 00, the three color components in the specified order.
    Using decimal numbers the yellow color would be written as rgb(255, 255, 0).</p>

    <p>All the possible colors are the combinations of 256 values taken 3 at a
    time, the number of which is 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216 which where the "16
    million colors" meme comes from.</p>

    <p>Check it yourself using the demo below. If the values are all zero the color
    is black, if all 255 then white. When the three values are equal the color is
    grey. Go on and move the values. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
    <h3 id="L2139">Binary numbers</h3>

    <p>We know that there are 32-bit computers and 64-bit computers. Previously
    there were 8-bit computers and 16-bit computers. What does this mean? Let's get
    into it.</p>

    <p>As we have already seen, in a byte we can store a number with a very limited
    set of values: only from zero to 255.</p>

    <p>Lumping two bytes together and managing the two bytes "word" as a single
    value expands the range of possible values to 2<span
    style="font-size: x-small; vertical-align: super;">16</span> = 65536 different
    values. </p>

    <p>For many applications these values are considered non-negative values
    ranging from zero though 65535. Other applications need to operate with
    negative numbers and in this case half of the values are zero or positive, and
    the other half are negative. The first bit of the first byte is designated to
    contain the sign, a "1" for negative numbers and a "0" for the others. Negative
    numbers are stored in a weird format called "<a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" target="_blank">two's complement</a>".
    </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>An application type that uses a lot of unsigned binary integers is "address
    arithmetic. </p>

    <p>Inside the computer the memory ("RAM" for Random Acces Memory) can be
    imagined (simplyfying) as a long array of bytes, each one having an address.
    The first one has address zero, the next has 1, and so on. Nowadays home PCs
    have 2GB bytes and more. That's about 2000 million bytes. </p>

    <p>When a program is operating, it has its data in the computer's memory (BTW,
    the running program is also in the same memory). If the program implemented a
    social-media application, and at a given moment it had a contacts list loaded
    in memory, and each contact was 120 bytes long (enough bytes to store the
    contact's data as the number, name, and something else), and all contact's data
    was stored in consecutive memory "positions" then to access the 12th. contact
    the program would have to calculate its address, thus: </p>

    <p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address of first contact + 120 × (contact number &minus;
    1)</code></p>

    <p>This is address arithmetic and it happens a lot of times. It is done with
    unsigned binary integer numbers because the byte addresses are positive, and
    because binary arithmetic is so fast.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>Normal computers can't directly add or multiply two numbers stored in
    memory. The programs have to use "registers", thus (for the example just
    above): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>load "contact number" in register</li>
      <li>decrement register by one</li>
      <li>multiply register by 120</li>
      <li>add "address of first contact" to register</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and the desired result would be in the register ready to be used. </p>

    <p>Think of the register as something similar to the pocket calculator display,
    that witnesses all the calculations you do. </p>

    <p>Similarly, pocket calculators have numeric displays measured in terms of
    number of digits, and the computers are classified in terms of the size of
    their registers expressed as a number of bits. Thus the 16-bit, 32-bit and
    64-bit PCs.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>Decades ago the computer operational circuits were very expensive. A 32-bit
    CPU's circuits are more complex that a 16-bit's so the 32-bit CPU was much more
    expensive. It's not only the registers that double their sizes, all the
    computer's internal data paths have to be enlarged too to fit the new "word"
    width (a "word" is the data that a CPU can handle in a single swoop or "cycle"
    and is measured by its number of bits). </p>

    <p>Enlarging the computer's word size is a way to make it faster, by enabling
    it to operate on twice as much data in the same time: a computer that has to
    use an 8-byte data item can retrieve it from its memory and store it in a
    register in a single cycle if it's a 64-bit CPU (because 8 bytes span 64 bits),
    but it will need at least two cycles if it was a 32-bit one. Think of the
    internal data paths as 32-lanes highways or 64-lanes super-highways. Both might
    have the same speed limit, but the wider one will be able to handle twice as
    much traffic per hour.</p>
