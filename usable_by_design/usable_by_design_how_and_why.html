<h1>Usable by design: how and why</h1>

<p>My client does its software development in house, but this time they hired me because they
needed a small application with high usability, as you will see. </p>

<p>They know about the user interfaces I do because I worked for them several years ago. </p>

<h2 id="L28">What's the application for?</h2>

<p>My client operates a complex system for recording and processing millions of traffic offenses
for one province. Part of the system involves the use of traffic speed sensors that measure the
speed of the vehicles and take a picture when said speed exceeds a limit. These are the so-called
"radars". </p>

<div style="margin: 1em 0em 1em 1.5em;">
<img alt="image of an offender" src="./usableByDesign/offender.png" class="imgR"></div>

<p>Every day they are handled a number DVDs containing thousands of pictures together with files
with supporting data like the location, the date and time, the speed, the "dominio" (Spanish for
"dominion", the legal name of the plate number), and more. </p>

<p>The automatic speed sensors take pictures without regarding if the vehicle is an ambulance
striving to save somebody's life, a police patrol, or a regular wrongdoer. </p>

<p>According to the law, if an ambulance or another public service vehicle gets fined they can go
to the court and demonstrate that they did it for good and the fine is waived. But having to go to
the court (maybe travelling several hundred kilometers) and losing a whole day is a chore that
raises complaints. </p>

<p>So, the idea is to <em>filter</em> out the data of the excepted vehicles before sending it to
the normal circuit. </p>

<p>The data is a huge number of text and image files, many gigabytes a day. It is handled by the
employees of the transit authority office, who are not expected to have any special qualifications
albeit the information is rather sensible and critical, and the volume is huge. </p>

<p>The filtering is to be done by means of a list of excepted plate numbers, provided by the
interested parts: police, hospitals, firemen, and others.</p>

<h2 id="L48">Requirements</h2>

<p>In brief, the business need is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mantain a list of excepted vehicles, </li>
  <li>filter the data against that list, and</li>
  <li>let anyone do the related tasks without special training. </li>
</ul>

<p>We are interested in the last requirement, the usability part. </p>

<h2 id="L64">Thinking of usability</h2>

<p>I detected that the usability requirement was especially aimed at reducing the additional
operations cost due to errors.</p>

<p>My client handled me a formal use case mainly devoted to the description of the data file
formats, and alloted me a lot of freedom. I rewrote the use case with focus on interaction. UCs are
for capturing functional requirements, and functionality is the closest thing to interaction. I
always rely in UCs for injecting interaction desing in a system's UI, as a first step before
wireframes and mockups, writing UCs that are not formal behemots but easy to read and understand.
</p>

<p>Let's recall the ISO/IEC definition of usability:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em"><cite>"The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to
achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of
use." </cite></p>

<p>Protecting the user from their own errors is the <em>effectiveness</em> part, the part that
affects the operational costs. Later on it came out that there was a stringent <em>efficiency</em>
requirement, because of the high volume of the data and the time it takes to filter it. The
<em>satisfaction</em> part tends to come out off the first two. </p>

<p>As protecting the users from their errors was the focus, I did mental walk-throughs of the UC
steps asking me what could go wrong at any step.</p>

<p>At this point it might be useful to recall that protecting the users from their errors is not
asking them "Are you sure that you want to wreck havoc?" in a pop-up modal dialog, but instead it
's about letting the users know what are they doing. In the next sections I will show the system
operation and comment on the features that are there to make the UI safe.</p>

<h3>General usability features</h3>

<p>There are many features built into the UI that are not visible but make the user's life easier,
like: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Forms are resizable, and the program will remember the window geometry and position across
    sessions. </li>
  <li>Column widths of the many reports available are also resizable, and the user preferred sizes
    are remembered across sessions on a per-report basis. </li>
  <li>No frills: the UI is as spartan as possible. This is how it has to be in applications that
    are to be used daily for work. A clean design reduces the cognitive load and the users are
    happier to operate the program. </li>
  <li>Normal action buttons are always located near the bottom right corner. The primary action
    button has its label bolded and is bigger, to make it more visible and also to make it a bigger
    mouse target (abiding by Fitt's law). </li>
  <li>All forms have a secondary "cancel" button, smaller and less noticeable, always at the right
    of the primary action button as usual in Windows. This button's help text communicates its
    funcion, and where appropriate it tells that no files will be written, thus reassuring the
    user. </li>
  <li>Always the primary button is activated by the enter ket, and the cancel button by the escape
    key, in all forms. Users start using these shortcuts automatically, without thinking of it, as
    it should be. </li>
  <li>The button labels describe the associated actions, clearly. It doesn't matter if the text
    gets a litle longer than in the usual button label. </li>
  <li>But button labels avoid useless repetitive initial words. For example in the main menu the
    actions are named in a way that the users can discards those they are not interested in by
    reading the first word only. To achieve this, in this menu, button labels are names instead of
    verbs, because a prepended verb would be repetitive. </li>
  <li>The button help texts avoid repeating what the button label already communicated, so the
    users will feel that they are getting fresh information. </li>
  <li>In all screens colors and fonts are always coherent, but ...</li>
  <li>Subtle color differences are used where appropriate, for example a slight change in the
    background color of the input controls that have focut, and a completely different backgtound
    color in the updateable exceptions list (to make it different form the report screens, that
    look the same). </li>
  <li>Labeling coherence is cheched: the same data element bears the same name everywhere. </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2 id="L90">Filtering</h2>

<p>This is the ultimate purpose of this application, and it is also the stage where errors are
significant. The kind of errors at this stage are related to skipping a file, delivering a file
more than once, or delivering incomplete file sets. Recall that a set is comprised of a file and
its related images in a folder.</p>

<h3 id="L94">Starting the program</h3>

<div style="clear:both; margin: 1em 3em 1em 1.5em;">
<img alt="the app's distinctive icon: a car with the usual prohibition signal on it"
src="./usableByDesign/CarNot_64x64.gif" class="imgL"></div>

<p>The program is a Windows application, so it can be started by double-clicking its icon.
Everybody is aware of this, but I mention it so I can introduce the application icon, a car with a
prohibition sign on it. Simple and disctinctive: don't fine this car.</p>

<div style="clear:both; margin: 1em 0em 1em 1.5em;">
<img alt="the initial menu enumerates the program functions" src="./usableByDesign/excep-menu.png"
class="imgR"></div>

<p>The main window is simply a menu that enumerates the available operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Filtering process</li>
  <li>Filtering history</li>
  <li>Exceptions registration</li>
  <li>Queries and reports</li>
  <li>Exceptions history</li>
  <li>Configuration</li>
  <li>End</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not the regular Windows menu comprised of a concealed list of small font items. This
menu always displays all its options, loud and clear, without the usual click to open, choosing,
and click again to select. Moreover, the most likely operation is already selected so it can be
activated by a single touch of the enter key.</p>

<div style="clear:both; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0em;">
<img alt="the initial menu showing help" src="./usableByDesign/menuHelp.png" class="imgL"></div>

<p>There is help everywhere. Hovering over an option displays a reasonable amount of information
about what will it do, in case the label is not enough. The help information is not a single short
text line but a readable window. Users don't read manuals (let alone thick manuals) so providing
easily reachable short and complete instructions can be the only opportunity to show them with
written instructions. </p>

<p>Every control in the application has its help popup that shows after hovering it for a short
while. </p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="L144">File filtering</h3>

<div style="clear:both; margin: 1em 0em 1em 1.5em;">
<img alt="selection of files to filter" src="./usableByDesign/filteringFileSelection.png"
class="imgR"></div>

<p>Clicking the "Proceso de filtrado" option ("Filtering process") opens the files selection
window. </p>

<p>This window has a number of user protection features, as it is the most critical one.</p>

<p>But before looking at them, a bit of context. The user designates a directory as its source
location in the configuration form; it will usually be a DVD reader. This screen enumerates all the
files found in said directory for the user to select which one to filter (usually all). </p>

<p>At the top of the screen there is a confirmation of the location of the input folder ("K:\") and
the DVD number. The users keep a record of the DVDs they handle, so seeing the DVD number is
reassuring. Near this heading there is a button to allow the user to switch to other directory
without having to tweak the configuration. The button is hidden in a corner and its label is not
bolded, to make it stay out of sight. The user will find it if the need arises. The button label
says it all: "change directory".</p>

<p>If the designated directory is a DVD reader and it is not ready, a "unit not ready" message is
shown and the form primary button changes to "retry". </p>

<p>The list of files has the least possible information, only the useful data: file name and
extension, date, and size. File sizes are in bytes whilst folder sizes are expressed in number of
files (images) contained.</p>

<p>Files are selectable, folders are not because the images are selected after their associated
file records. The user can't select a file without its images folder or viceversa.</p>

<p>The files with .txt extension are selected by default, other file types have to be explicitely
selected. </p>

<p>In addition to have a check box that makes them different from folders, file names are bolded in
an eyecatching fashion. And, the button that triggers the filtering process displays the number of
files found as a reasuring measure, because not all files are visible all the time. Changing the
selection updates the number in the button, of course. </p>

<p>There is a cancel secondary button. It has its help information, same as the menu. In this case
the help says that clicking this button cancels the process and that no files will be modified.
This is quite reassuring.</p>

<p>As in all screens, the design is haken to it minimum. There are only controls for the actions
the user needs, and nothing else. The window does not shot that it is possible to resize it, or
resize the column widths, until you try to do it. Then it communicates these affordances by
displaying the usual double-arrow mouse pointers. </p>

<h3 id="L170">Operation of the file filtering interaction </h3>

<div style="clear:both; margin: 1em 0em 1em 1.5em;">
<img alt="ongoing filtering process report" src="./usableByDesign/filteringReport.png"
class="imgR"></div>

<p>The filtering process is a batch process, i.e., it is not interactive. Once it is started, the
progran only has to keep the user informed about its progress. It does so by logging all what it
does in a report screen. It also writes the same information in a log file, for the techies to look
in case of a problem: more user protection, as they are ot required to take note of the error
messages and other ancillary information. </p>

<p>Behing the scenes the program builds a directory where it will put the output files of this
process, giving it a unique but predictable name. One such name can be "PROD_00042-1" where the
"00042" part is a sequential process number. During the filtering process that name will be
"PROD_00042-1-INCOMPLETO" signaling that the directori holds the output of an incomplete process.
Only after everything ends happily the program will change the name, deleting the "-INCOMPLETO"
part. This protects the user from sending a set of files in the belief that it is right, being that
in the last minute or when the user winked, it failed. </p>

<p>When the user is done with a successful filtering task, they have to gather the files and send
them to be processed. Again the application guides the user steps, as it opens a Windows Explorer
zeroed in the output directory just built. There might be many directories with like names striving
to make a human err, but a program will not be fooled: it will always open the featured directory.
Once more the users are protected of their own errors.</p>

<h3 id="L182">Cancelled processes</h3>

<p></p>

<div style="clear:both; margin: 1em 0em 1em 1.5em;">
<img alt="cancelled filtering process report" src="./usableByDesign/filteringCancelled.png"
class="imgR"></div>

<p>Anyway, if the process is cancelled either by user action or because of an error, the screen
changes its color. This way the user is protected of the problems arising if they don't notice that
something failed, for example, a hard disk full condition.</p>

<p>Notice that after the process ends the cancel button is relabeled "retornar" ("return") because
its function has changed.</p>

<p>Also, after a cancellation by the user, the program deletes all the files written during the
failed process. Even if the users don't notice the colored screen and the messages, there will be
no files to send, they will see an empty directory. Somewhere else a log file will have information
about what happened, something like an aircraft's black box. </p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="L204">Managing excepted vehicles</h2>

<p>Managing the list of excepted vehicles is the other set of interactions, required to be able to
do the filtering. </p>

<p>This process is not as critical as the filtering one, by far. In this part I put the emphasis in
making the users' life easier, albeit still caring about protecting them.</p>

<h3 id="L210">A bit of context</h3>

<p>The list has several thousand items. Each one in comprised of the "dominio" (plate number), an
owner usually some Government office, a validity period , and a few more data columns like who
registered it when. </p>

<p>Every now and then a list is sent by another office asking th except some vehicles, for example
by email or in paper. The users simply add the requested exceptions to the list. </p>

<h3 id="L216">Avoiding the design of the interaction</h3>

<p>In my experience, it is not possible to know in advance how will the users work. Usera will do
as they want, using the UI in surprising ways one wouldn't predict. Aditionally, I didn't have any
contact with the users, not at all, so I was unable to get a glimpse of what were them willing to
do. </p>

<p>But I got a current excepted vehicles list and analyzed its content. The defects it contained
spoke about the issues they were facing. Actually it was more shouting than speaking.</p>

<p>The most noticeable issue was that they were writing down the names of the requesting offices
instead of having a list to select from. I noticed it because there were several versions of each
name differing in abreviations or simply punctuation, for example "PODER EJEC. DE LA PCIA. DE
BUENOS AIRES-POLICIA BONAERENSE" and "PODER EJEC. PCIA. BS. AS.-POLICIA BONAERENSE" refer to the
same. Check the variations on one Ministery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO DDE LA PROV. DE BS. AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO DE AL PROV. DE BS. AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO DE LA PROV. DE BS. AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO DE LA PROV. DE BS.AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PCIA BS.AS-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PCIA BS.AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PCIA DE BS.AS-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PCIA DE BS.AS. -MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PCIA DE BS.AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PCIA DE BS.AS.MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PCIA. DE BS.AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PROV. DE BS.AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PROVINCIA BS.AS.-MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PROVINCIA BUENOS AIRES - MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO</li>
  <li>PODER EJECUTIVO PROVINCIA DE BS.AS.- MINISTERIO DE GOBIERNO-</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The names were out of control; it was nos possible to get a list of all the vehicles related to
one dependence without having to read the complete roster. I dropped my a-priori plan of exposing a
list of vehicle owners and relate each vehicle to an item in this list because is was not the way
they were working, despite being the most logical and usual way.</p>

<p>The other thing I noticed after observing the list was that they recorded the data as it came,
freely, relating hehicles to offices or persons or whatever. </p>

<p>I decided to go the same way: provide a free environment where they could do what they want,
tidy or sloppy. I did so and after a while I was told that "they were in a process to bring
reorganize the list" which I interpreted that with a new, better, tool they felt empowered to tame
the chaos.</p>

<p>Disgression: May be this is related to the hype about "<em>designing the experience</em>". I
strongly beleive that we don't <em>design the experience</em>, but instead we can offer an ambient
where the users can build their own experience. We can only provide some bias. In this case I
provided a helphul hoerking environment and my users decided to leverage its power.</p>

<h3 id="L286">How not to design?</h3>

<p>Or, should I say <em>overdesign</em>? </p>

<p>Software developers love constraints. I know because I'm one. Especially data constraints, like
"each vehicle owner will be a known Government office" and the like.</p>

<p>Also, developers are wary of the performance impact of their decisions, like for example loading
<em>the whole</em> excpetions list. We care about what would happen if the list was comprised of
too many items, even when such numbers would be ridiculous. One fact is that nowadays hardware is
so powerful that almost anything is possible, given that it is well designed and crafted. </p>

<p>In short, I gave up about structuring data and decided to expose the whole list in a grid
allowing the users to freely interact with it, as if it was an Excel spreadsheet. </p>

<p>The menu item is labeled "Registración de excepciones (Exceptions recording). This is another
label that leaves no doubts about the action it triggers. (Additionally, notice that almost all
label texts are crafted so the users can choose then by reading only the first word, to reduce the
cognitive load.)</p>

<h3 id="L304">Interacting with a long list</h3>

<p>After choosing the option, a window opens with a grid housing the whole exceptions list, a few
thousand items. Of course, before going this way I checked the performance impact (I still have
developer peeves) and it was acceptable. Digging a litle bit more I found a way to load the data in
a fraction of a second, completely blowing the performance issues.</p>

<p>Leaving the user alone in front of such a long grid would have been cruel. But they are given a
tool, a search box. This search box is the simplest to operate: the users write something and when
they make a short pause the list shortens to include only the rows that contain all the search
words. No need to click let alone open a search parameters form. Just type and see what happens, if
it's still not right then type more, or less, or something else.</p>

<p>This design supports both targeted searchs (an exact plate number, for example) or exploratory
searchs (all items related to "policia").</p>

<p>As it is assumed that the user will always have to do a search, when the windows opens the focus
is in the search box, depriving the users to do an additional useless mouse click.</p>

<p>As usual it is possible to click the column headings to sort the whole list on a column, but
what actually empowers the users is the search feature. As a security measure, this list has blue
headings instead of the regular light gray ones of other screens that have the same format, because
it is editable. The program requires the users to enter a password before opening it. </p>

<h3 id="L316">Editing an item</h3>

<p>Clicking a litk item of the list opens it in an edit dialog, which also has a host of usability
features.</p>

<p>In this case the most visible feature is a control to enter the vehicle owner's name, made up of
a text box and a list. The user can enter text in the box, and the list, immediately below it,
instantly shows the already registered owner names that contain the text just written. The user can
click in one of the offered names, or enter a new one. There are no restrictions.</p>

<p>For example writing "federal" shows several versions of "POLICIA FEDERAL ARGENTINA" for the user
to choose. </p>

<p>In addition of helping the users to enter long names, this feature provides extra value in that
it makes the users aware of the multiple versions of some names. </p>
