    <h4 id="jpmorgan"><strong>2016 ~ 2017</strong> Development of a microservice for JPMorgan, in Globant</h4>

    <p><img alt="JPMorgan" src="./res/256px-J_P_Morgan_Logo_2008_1.svg.png" class="imgR"
       style="margin: .5em 0.5em .5em 2em; width:140px; "> 
    Development of a user and client profiles microservice for the Bank's global
    international trading application, that moves billions of dollars by the hour. </p>
    <p>My work, as a Business Analyst, was to manage the team backlog using Jira and an 
    <em>agile</em> process for a 10 or 12 developers team. </p>
    <p>The software was developed in Java, to run in the bank's Tier-3 UNIX servers. </p>
    <p>It is the critical application type that, if it fails, the Bank loses millions of
    dollars every single minute. We completed the task and successfully deployed to production. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="verizon"><strong>2012 ~ 2013</strong> Production support for Verizon's F&E mainframe system, in Globant</h4>

    <p><img alt="Verizon" src="./res/verizon-logo-300x300.jpg" class="imgR"
       style="margin: .5em 0.5em .5em 2em; width:120px; "> 

    I took part, as a programmer, in the team that provided global support to Verizon's 
    "F&amp;E" system that provisions point-to-point communication lines and does the 
    invoicing, a few billions a month. </p>
    <p>The system runs in an IBM mainframe, and was developed in <em>CA Ideal</em>, a
    vintage 4GL similar to COBOL that I had to quickly master to be able to do my work. </p>
    <p>Additionally, using Excel VBA, as a personal initiative I automated a report that
    went from a daily 2-hours task to a 10-minutes one. </p>

    <p> </p>


    <h4 id="sentinel"><strong>2011</strong> Sentinel: a test-cases management application, in Globant</h4>

    <p><img alt="Sentinel" src="./res/sentinel.png" class="imgR"
    style="margin: .5em 0.5em .5em 2em; width:140px; "> 

    I took part in the development of this test-cases management tool named
    Sentinel, to be open-sourced. </p>
    <p>I was appointed as a BA because of my Usability / UX skills, given that
    the application was intended to be used full-time by hundreds of testers 
    so any usability enhancements were going to have a significant impact in
    the cost and the final quality of the projects where the tool was to be
    used. </p>
    <p>I ended up performing as the PM (Project Manager) of the project in
    addition to doing its design (backlog). </p>
    <p>The project was discontinued due to lack of support, despite the high
    interest of the testers that were expectant. <p>

    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="telecom"><strong>2011</strong> "Telecom Pilot Test" project, in Globant</h4>

    <p><img alt="Telecom" src="./res/logoTelecom.png" class="imgR" style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; ">

    The project goal was to migrate part of the COBOL programs and jobs of
    Telecom Argentina's giant invoicing application from an IBM Mainframe 
    to the Micro Focus environment. It was a 7-month effort for a team of 
    8 people. </p>
    <p>The programs chosen were the most complex, some of them were more
    that 50K LOC. </p>
    <p>My work was to provide or recreate all the additional software required
    (I emulated some Control-M features), test COBOL + DB2 programs, migrate
    the JCL, and to edit the final report. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="excepciones"><strong>2011</strong>  Excepted vehicles filter, for Boldt S.A. </h4>

    <p><img alt="Excepciones" src="./res/excepciones.png" class="imgR"
      style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; ">
    
    Boldt operates the traffic tickets data collection system in the 
    Provincia de Buenos Aires. </p>
    <p>For that system, they chartered me with the design and development
    of a software to filter the offenses made by excepted vehicles, like
    ambulances or police cars. </p>
    <p>As the system processes gigabytes of critical information (data and
    pictures output by radar or lidar kinemometers), and the filtering
    stage has to be run on premises by largely untrained personal, the
    application needed to have very high usability. That's why they 
    resorted to me. </p>
    <p>I provided them a zero-defect application that runs without a
    glitch. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="cafam"><strong>2010</strong> Cafam portal, in Globant</h4>

    <p><img alt="Cafam" src="./res/Cafam.png" class="imgR" style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; ">
    
    The client is a big private organization that operates a network of government
    subsides for low-income workers. </p>
    <p>The main purpose of the portal is to promote their hospitality, tourism, supermarket,
    education, insurance, sports ... offerings among their 500K affiliates by publishing
    infomercial articles.  </p>

    <p>As the BA and Usability / UX expert I designed an application that exceeded the
    client's expectations. </p>

    <p>My design automated the choice of articles to be shown to each affiliate. </p>
    
    <p>The articles compete to be published depending on the affiliate's needs and their
    profiles, and article's parameters like age, interest and <em>interest devaluation</em>
    policy. </p>
     
    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="oag"><strong>2006 ~ 2007</strong> OAG Sequence &amp; Load for OAG, in Globant</h4>

    <p><img alt="oag" src="./res/OAG-Logo.png" class="imgR"
       style="margin: .5em 0.5em .5em 2em; width:120px; "> 

    OAG compiles the flight schedules of all the airlines in the World. The data
    is sold to the big online ticketing sites. </p>
    <p>They were migrating their applications from IBM mainframe with VSAM files
    to AIX with IBM DB2. </p>
    <p>My mission, as a Senior DB2 developer, was to refactor several huge complex 
    undocumented stored procedures that blocked the progress of the project. </p>
    <p>After a while, scripts that would crash the server after running for 30 hours,
    ended happily in 20 minutes. </p>
     
    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="padrones"><strong>2005</strong> Boldt - Voters roll printing </h4>

    <p><img alt="Boldt" src="./res/Boldt.png" class="imgR" style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; ">
    
    Boldt printed the electoral roll for the 2005 Argentine National elections, about
    40M pages. </p>
    <p>A task previous to the printing itself was the capture of the 24 districts (states)
    registries data that happens twice, once before and once after updating it. </p>
    <p>The delegates of some districts have complained to the Federal Gov about several days 
    delays in the data capture. The company was facing a harsh contract breach trial. </p>
    <p>I volunteered to solve this by designing and developing a new application during the
    four weeks available for data updating before printing the definitive version. </p>
    <p>The outcome was so good that Boldt received a felicitation note in place of the 
    original complain letter. </p>
    <p>A significant part of the success was due to the usability / UX of the application. It
    was easy to learn and use, and remembered each district's options in between sessions
    so re-processing was very quick. </p>
    <p>The application was developed for Windows PCs using Microsoft VB6 and Access SQL. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="facturacion"><strong>2005</strong> Boldt - Check personalization invoicing</h4>
    <p><img alt="Check personalization invoicing" src="./res/PerFact.png" class="imgR"
                                                                     style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; "> 

    Boldt provides personalized check books for a number of banks, like Bank
    of America and others. This is millions of checks per month in 25- and 50
    sized checkbooks. </p>

    <p>I designed and implemented a highly usable application to do the
    invoicing of this service and a number of related reports. </p>

    <p>The new application shortened the task from 4 days to couple hours,
    with much better results. </p>

    <p>It also replaced the printing of thousands of pages by Excel files
    sent by email, with a positive impact in the client's work and the
    environment. </p>

    <p>The application was developed using VB6, Access and Excel VBA. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="personalizado"><strong>2003 ~ 2005</strong> Boldt - Personalized checkbooks printing</h4>
    <p><img alt="Personalized checkbooks printing" src="./res/Personalizado.png" class="imgR"
      style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; "> 

    Boldt provides personalized checkbooks for a number of big banks
    in Argentina. The personalization means printing the client data, account,
    check number, routing, etc. </p>

    <p>This task requires excruciating security measures, as any error (like a
    duplicated check) is an opportunity for a fraud. </p>

    <p>During my performance the quality evolved from 12 defects/year to about
    zero. </p>

    <p>A significant factor was the enhanced usability of the UI used to capture
    the requirements sent by the banks, operated during the night by blue-collar
    factory workers. </p>

    <p>  </p>

    <h4 id="crusa"><strong>1999 ~ 2001</strong> Informatization of Caminos del Río Uruguay S.A. </h4>

    <div>
      <p><img alt="Aggregates transportation" src="./res/TMicon2-90.png" class="imgR"
         style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; "> 

      CRUSA was an old-fashioned constructions business that builds and exploits the
      Zarate-Brazo Largo to Paso de los Libres highway. It completely lacked an IT
      policy and practice. </p>

      <p>I designed and implemented (partially, until the Argentine 2001 crisis 
      happened) a custom ERP application to build a bridge integrating the
      technical and the administrative areas data that would do direct cost reporting
      and planning. </p>

      <p>Among the first components implemented was the Aggregates Transportation
      module. </p>

      <p>The users were engineers, foremen and administrative clerks with deep
      knowledge of the construction things but no IT experience. No need to say
      that high usability was a must in order to buy adoption from the users. </p>

      <p>It reduced to minutes some tasks that formerly would take days. </p>

      <p>It was a client-server application developed with MS VB6 and IBM DB2 in
      the back end. </p>
    </div>

    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="nenuca"><strong>1998</strong> Cereals harvest contracts and exports, Nenuca S.A. </h4>

    <p><img alt="Cereals harvest contracts and exports" src="./res/wheat-grain.png" class="imgR"
    style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; width:100px; "> 

    <p>I implemented the complexity of the harvest purchase contracts in an easy
    to use application. </p>

    <p>The users of this application were <em>extreme</em>: either 70-years-old 
    computer-illiterates who were afraid of technology or 20-years-old wizards. </p>

    <p>I designed and implemented a UI that satisfied all of them. Users only 
    needed to know about harvest contracts and international commerce, the system
    was fully transparent. </p>

    <p>The system acceptance was amazing. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="y2k">1999  Y2K tools </h4>
    <p><img alt="Y2K" src="./res/Y2K.png" class="imgR" style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; ">
     
    This year my work was special because of the software fixings in
    preparation for year 2000. </p>

    <p>Some of my clients that required service were AMSA (Met Life), NOBLEX
    (Sanyo), Editorial La Ley (Thompson Publishing) and others. </p>

    <p>After analyzing the available tools, including IBM's, I concluded that
    due to their low usability it was almost easier to do the work by hand. </p>

    <p>So I rolled out my own tool. I used VB6 to load the codebase into DB2 and
    recursive SQL queries to find the spots to fix. </p>

    <p>Using this tool we delivered on schedule without defects and without
    heroic efforts. Actually, it was a pleasant work to do. </p>

    <p>Since I started to work with computers I developed <em>tools</em> for
    others or me myself to use. This is an important influence in my development:
    to think the applications as tools for the users to achieve their goals
    with efficiency, efficacy and satisfaction - User Centered Design. </p>

    <h4 id="faro"><strong>1998</strong> Faro Buenos Aires, online CDs store</h4>

    style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; ">

    It was the typical online store of the late nineties developed with ASP3
    scripts. It was my entry point to the Internet technologies. I was the
    <em>webmaster</em>. </p>

    <p>In addition to learning about Internet, I applied my previous usability
    experience acquired during years of developing and deploying desktop 
    applications, to take the site's UI to a much higher level. </p>

    <p>It was in this context that I started to formalize my usability experience,
    realizing that <em>I knew it</em> but by hart, my knowledge was not yet
    organized. <br>
    I started reading everything about the subject (that was starting to explode),
    and to participate in international forums. </p>

    <p>I already had experience about how to get a glimpse at the users' cravings
    and leveraged it big time. </p>

    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>

    <h4 id="cg5"><strong>1980 ~ 2010</strong> My own business software company</h4>
    <p><img alt="Tecnosol" src="./res/tecnosol.png" class="imgR" style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; "> 

    I was riding my own software development business. The plan was to develop generic
    business software (accounting, payroll, ...) and to license it to clients. </p>

    <p>In 1980 we had the first products and started to roll them. We had mainframe 
    fortune-500 clients like XEROX, AMSA (Met Life), Techint, and smaller
    <em>minicomputer</em> clients that ran interactive versions using terminals
    (which was innovative then). </p>

    <p>The software was very successful in that the users loved it. One client paid
    to use it during 25 years. </p>

    <p>The relationship with our clients taught me a lot about how to interact in 
    order to understand their needs. I really got the gist of usability design. </p>

    <p>An interesting side is efficiency. Two of my clients (Lautrec Publicidad 
    and Distribuidora Bertrán) multiplied their operations volume by 4x or more,
    and at the end the crew was smaller that initially, with huge enhancements
    in the information availability. </p>

    <p>The applications were developed in COBOL. There was an IBM Mainframe codebase,
    and a minicomputer codebase that was ported to a number of platforms (IBM
    Series/1, IBM System/34 and /36, Wang VS, Digital VAX, UNIX and PCs) using
    tools I developed for this purpose. </p>

    <p><img alt="Armetal" src="./res/Armetal.png" class="imgR"
    style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 2em; ">
    
    Armetal S.A. (Dana Holding Corporation) makes auto parts, especially for
    Ford. </p>
    
    <p>Due to inflation they renegotiate their prices. They have to justify the
    price increases with cost increases (iron, work, electricity, paint...) for
    each and every article (hundreds). </p>

    <p>As Ford recognizes the validity of the new prices from the moment the cost
    analysis sheets are received, they harried to finish working overnight or
    during weekends. </p>

    <p>With the interactive application I made for them (for an IBM system/34)
    they could do the work in minutes, as they only had to inform the system
    of a few cost changes. </p>

    <p>Their ROI was impressing: they redeemed the cost with the value increase
    of the next truck that left the factory. </p>

    <h3 id="L899">Succinct history</h3>

    <p>I had my first computer, an <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1620" target="_other"
    style="display:inline;">IBM 1620</a>, in mid-1963 when I was a 18
    years old engineering student. Since then I focus in computers. <br>
    I was able to use that computer full time, and I did. </p>

    <p>Over time my interest evolved from the original technical focus
    to the human side of HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) as I noticed
    that albeit the computers were a promise of happiness, often the
    opposite happened. </p>

    <p>In order to bring some happiness to Humankind, between 1974 and
    2001 I led my own usable software development organization,
    selling or renting licenses to companies like XEROX, Techint, AMSA
    (Met Life), Bonafide, NOBLEX (Sanyo), La Ley (Thompson Publishing)
    and others. They were very fond of my products. </p>

    <p>In 2001 after the deep crisis, my clients became an extinct species. </p>

    <p>So I was hired by Boldt and then Globant where I worked for 11 years
    until I legally retired in September 2017. </p>

    <p>Currently I'm developing a web site for intercultural food recipes
    sharing. </p>
